# NachoBot

## What it does
When a tweet contains "#askYP" in it, our bot replies with the first suggesting that the API provides. If the location is not provided in the Tweet message, we reply back to the user asking for a city.

## How we built it
We used Python 3.5, TextRazor, YP API and Tweepy in order to parse the information and reply back.

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges trying to figure out how to retrieve the location / longitude, latitude from the Twitter API

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Finishing our first Hackathon challenge!

## What we learned
We learned how to integrate various APIs together in order to accomplish the challenge provided by Yellow Page.
